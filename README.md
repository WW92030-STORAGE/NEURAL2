# NEURAL2
  
Revamped version of the old archived NEURAL repository.

NEURAL2 is a torch-like collection of neural-network-related classes and structures used for doing simple machine learning tasks. It is modular and supports various different operations. Like VSC (the renderer I made previously), this is made entirely using software.
  
# CREDITS  
  
Modularity is based on PyTorch/Tensorflow. The computational algorithms are based on various resources obtained on the internet, some of which are credited in the runner files.

# HOW TO USE THIS

Only `main.cpp` for now.

# HOW TO RECREATE THIS  
  
Read through the header files for information on how neural networks learn and operate.
